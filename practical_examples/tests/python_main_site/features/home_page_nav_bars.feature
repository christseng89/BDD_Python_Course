Feature: Navigation bars in the home page

    Scenario: Verify the navigation bars on home page are visible

      Given I go to the site "python.org"
      Then the "main navigation" bar should be visible
      And the "top navigation" bar should be visible
      And the "options" bar should be visible
      And the "main header" bar should be visible
